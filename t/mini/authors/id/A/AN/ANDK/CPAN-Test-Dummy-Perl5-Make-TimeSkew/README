This CPAN distribution file is designed for testing purposes only. It
has no usefulness in itself.

The test script that works with this file is t/31sessions.t in the
CPAN.pm distribution.

The test tries to determine if the installer (CPAN.pm or anybody else)
can deal with timestamps in the future.
